## Introduction

The Phone Number Details Fetcher is a Python script that provides a convenient way to retrieve information related to a phone number. By utilizing various APIs and libraries, it fetches carrier details, location information, and placeholder social media profiles (which can be replaced with actual implementation). 

## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the following components installed:

- Python 3.x
- phonenumbers
- requests
- beautifulsoup4
- tkinter

To install the required dependencies, use the following command:

pip install phonenumbers requests beautifulsoup4


## Usage

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `phone_number_details.py`.

2. Run the script using the following command:

3. The script will launch a graphical user interface (GUI) window.

4. Enter the phone number you want to fetch details for in the input field.

5. Click the "Fetch Details" button.

6. The script will validate the phone number, fetch carrier information, location details, and display placeholder social media profiles (which can be customized with actual implementation).

7. The fetched details will be shown in the output text box.

## Customization

The Phone Number Details Fetcher can be customized according to your specific requirements:

- Replace the placeholder API URLs (`https://api.example.com/carrier/{phone_number}` and `https://www.example.com/location/{phone_number}`) in the `fetch_carrier_details` and `fetch_location_details` functions with actual URLs for fetching carrier and location details.

- Implement the actual code in the `fetch_social_media_profiles` function to fetch social media profiles based on the phone number.

Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs and add any additional features you require.
